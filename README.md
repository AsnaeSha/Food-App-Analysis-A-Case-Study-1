# Swiggy-Data-Analysis
SQL PROJECT


I am excited to present my Swiggy Case Study, a personalized project that demonstrates my proficiency in data analysis and SQL querying. In this project, I harnessed data from tables such as food, users, orders, order_details, and restaurants to derive actionable insights and address key business questions.

Using SQL as my primary tool, I navigated through intricate datasets to uncover valuable trends and patterns in Swiggy's operations. By answering questions like identifying customers who have never ordered, calculating the average price of dishes, determining the top restaurants in terms of orders for a specific month, and isolating restaurants with monthly sales exceeding a certain threshold, I offered a comprehensive analysis that contributes to data-driven decision-making.

One of the highlights of this project was my exploration of restaurant-customer interactions. I identified restaurants with the highest repeated customer count or loyal customers, providing insights into customer preferences and brand loyalty.

By synthesizing complex data through SQL queries, I effectively communicated findings that could be used for strategic planning and enhancing Swiggy's customer experience. This project showcases my analytical mindset, ability to work with real-world datasets, and dedication to translating data into actionable insights.

I am enthusiastic about featuring this case study on my resume, as it underscores my commitment to utilizing data analysis to drive informed decisions. The Swiggy Case Study highlights my skill in extracting insights from raw data, and I am eager to apply these capabilities to contribute meaningfully to future analytical challenges.
